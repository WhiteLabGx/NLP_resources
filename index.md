# This is Whitelab Genomics' list of useful NLP resources : 

Please note, this resource is currently under construction and will be updated regularly.

## Resources and APIs :

- [ISTEX](https://www.istex.fr/) 

23 millions de documents provenant de 28 corpus de littérature scientifique dans toutes les disciplines.

- [Pubmed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) & [pubmed central](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/)

PubMed comprises more than 30 million citations for biomedical literature from MEDLINE, life science journals, and online books. Citations may include links to full-text content from PubMed Central and publisher web sites. 

PubMed Central® (PMC) is a free full-text archive of biomedical and life sciences journal literature at the U.S. National Institutes of Health's National Library of Medicine (NIH/NLM). 

- [Gargantext](https://gargantext.org/)

A web platform to explore text-mining, developped by the [isc-pif](https://iscpif.fr/). Gargantext is designed to produce living maps that evolve as you work with them. They can be used for dressing a state-of-the-art, mapping a bunch of documents, setting up a collective representation of a problem, etc. The map is not the ultimate goal, rather, it is the back and forth between the different levels of your corpora (document, terms, maps, etc.) that is the main resource and help you to build an adaptive representation of a question or a problem.


- [Spacy](https://spacy.io/) & [SciSpacy](https://allenai.github.io/scispacy/)

Spacy is a python library providing "industrial strength language processing". SciSpacy is a python package developed by the Allen Institute containing spaCy models for processing biomedical, scientific or clinical text.
In particular, there is a custom tokenizer that adds tokenization rules on top of spaCy's rule-based tokenizer, a POS tagger and syntactic parser trained on biomedical data and an entity span detection model. Separately, there are also NER models for more specific tasks.


- [NaCTeM](http://www.nactem.ac.uk/index.php)

The National Centre for Text Mining (NaCTeM) is the first publicly-funded text mining centre in the world. We provide text mining services in response to the requirements of the UK academic community. NaCTeM is operated by the University of Manchester.

On the website, you can find pointers to sources of information about text mining such as links to

        - text mining services provided by NaCTeM
        software tools, both those developed by the NaCTeM team and by other text mining groups
        - seminars, general events, conferences and workshops
        - tutorials and demonstrations
        - text mining publications

- [TAPoR](http://tapor.ca/home)

TAPoR is a gateway to the tools used in sophisticated text analysis and retrieval.

The project is led by Geoffrey Rockwell, Stéfan Sinclair, and Milena Radzikowska and housed at the University of Alberta.

 With TAPoR 3.0 you can:

        - Discover text manipulation, analysis, and visualization tools
        - Discover historic tools
        - Read tool reviews and recommendations
        - Learn about papers, articles and other sources about specific tools
        - Tag, comment, rate, and review collaboratively
        - Browse lists of related tools in order to discover tools more easily
